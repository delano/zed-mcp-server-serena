            Please review this pull request for a Zed editor extension that integrates Serena (semantic code analysis toolkit) via MCP.

            Focus on these key areas:
            - Rust code quality and safety patterns
            - WebAssembly compatibility for Zed extensions
            - Error handling and edge cases
            - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
            - Security considerations for extension API usage
            - Python executable detection and fallback logic
            - MCP server command invocation correctness
            
            Pay special attention to:
            - Correct MCP server command invocation (we recently fixed a critical bug here)
            - Extension API usage patterns following Zed conventions
            - Error handling in restricted environments
            - The extension executes external Python processes so security is important
